A keylogger is a type of surveillance software designed to record every keystroke made by a user on a keyboard. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:

Functionality: Keyloggers can capture sensitive information, such as passwords, identification numbers, or any text input by the user. This makes them potentially harmful if used for malicious purposes.

Implementation Methods:

Local Implementation: Keyloggers can be set up to save captured keystrokes in a local file or send the captured data via email. In ethical hacking contexts, they can be utilized for testing the security of a system by demonstrating how easily sensitive information can be intercepted.
Silent Operation: Many keyloggers run in the background without the user’s knowledge. This means that after installation, the user may not see any visible signs of the software’s operation.
Common Uses:

In cybersecurity training, keyloggers are used to demonstrate the importance of securing sensitive data and to educate users on the risks associated with unprotected systems.
They can also serve legitimate purposes in monitoring employee behavior on corporate networks or parental control settings.
Tech Implementation: In a typical project involving the creation of a keylogger, you might start by installing the necessary libraries (such as pynput in Python) to track keyboard strokes, and then write the code to capture and store the keystrokes.
